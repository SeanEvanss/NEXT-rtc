# NEXT-rtc
This project is focused on implementing a web chat application using webRTC. The frontend and middleware will be handled by NEXT.js, which was mainly selected so that I can get more practice. There will also a be firestore instance that we will use for signalling purposes (this might be swapped out of the tech stack further in development).
